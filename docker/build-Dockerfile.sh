# Docker Build Script for ATT&CK Workbench Frontend
#
# Purpose:
#   This script builds and pushes Docker images for the ATT&CK Workbench
#   Frontend. It's designed to be called by semantic-release during
#   the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
#
# Usage:
#   ./docker-build.sh <version> <release_type> <git_sha>
#
# Parameters:
#   - version: Semantic version (e.g. 1.2.3 or 1.2.3-alpha.1)
#   - release_type: Type of release (e.g. "major", "minor", "patch", "prerelease")
#   - git_sha: Git commit SHA of the build
#
# Behavior:
#   - For non-prerelease builds (release_type != "prerelease"),
#     the image is tagged with both the version and "latest"
#   - For prerelease builds (from alpha, beta, etc. branches),
#     the image is tagged only with the version (no "latest")
#
# Called by:
#   .releaserc file via @semantic-release/exec plugin
