# Description
# - This file augments the deployment of the ATT&CK Workbench by configuring the REST API container
# - with an additional certificate.
# - This is recommended for deployments where the REST API container is behind a firewall that performs
#   SSL inspection. The additional certificate allows the REST API collection management to retrieve 
#   Collection Indexes and Collection bundles without receiving a self-signed certificate error.

# Usage
# This file must be used in conjunction with the main docker-compose.yml file.
#
# Environment Variables
# HOST_CERTS_PATH: path to the directory on the host where the certificate file is located
# CERTS_FILENAME: name of the certificate file
#
# Running docker compose at the command line:
# docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.certs.yml up
