Some instances of software have multiple names associated with the same instance due to various organizations tracking the same set of software by different names. The team makes a best effort to track overlaps between names based on publicly reported associations, which are designated as &quot;Associated Software&quot; on each page (also known as &quot;Aliases&quot;)."
